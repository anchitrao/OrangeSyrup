The spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is
it in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe
it fully. Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow
made luminous and as nearly everything in the heavens is luminous the
instrument has a great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of
analysing light we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of
different lengths. What we call light is a series of minute waves in
ether and these waves are measuring them from crest to crest so to
say of various lengths. Each wave length corresponds to a colour of the
rainbow. The shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour and
the largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow in fact is a
sort of natural spectrum. The meaning of the rainbow is that the
moisture laden air has sorted out these waves in the sun's light
according to their length. Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a
glass prism a triangular shaped piece of glass. If white light
sunlight for example passes through a glass prism we see a series of
rainbow tinted colours. Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is
shining through any kind of cut glass the stopper of a wine decanter
for instance. If instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights
as they emerge from the glass prism we allow them to fall on a screen
we shall find that they pass by continuous gradations from red at the
one end of the screen through orange yellow green blue and indigo
to violet at the other end. In other words what we call white light is
composed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect
which we call white. And now just as water can be split up into its two
elements oxygen and hydrogen so sunlight can be broken up into its
primary colours which are those we have just mentioned.
